<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Management Science at the Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received the PhD degree in Operations Research and Analytics from the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at National University of Singapore in 2022. I was jointly advised by <a href="https://www.teochungpiaw.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Chung Piaw Teo</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lixiaobohome/home" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Xiaobo Li</a>. I received the M.S. degree in Management Science and Engineering from South China University of Technology, and the B.Eng. degree in Environmental Engineering from the Ocean University of China. Prior to graduate study, I spent three years working as a Design Engineer in the construction industry.
</p>
<p>My research interests lie in data-driven decision making and its applications to pricing and revenue management problems. My current research focuses on the design and pricing of product bundles and ancillary services under complex customer choice behavior. This line of research is mainly motivated by collaborations with an airline company. I am also interested in applying Data Analytics to solve operational challenges related to energy, sustainability and social good.
